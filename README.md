Belfry OpenScad Utility

**STILL IN PLANNING**

A general multi-purpose utility to help work with OpenSCAD.

Things this can do:
- Convert text files to OpenSCAD .scad file string lists.
- Convert image files to OpenSCAD .scad file heightfield arrays.
- Convert STL files to OpenSCAD .scad file Vertex'N'Face arrays.
- Validate STL files.
- More as I think of it.
